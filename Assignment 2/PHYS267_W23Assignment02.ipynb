He identified heterozygous individuals for flower colour that had two alleles: $r$ for the recessive white colour allele and $R$ for the dominant red colour allele. When these individuals were mated, 3/4 of the offspring were observed to have red flowers and 1/4 had white flowers. This probability table helps to summarize this mating and the genetics of their offspring:\n",
